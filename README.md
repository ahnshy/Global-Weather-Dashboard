## 🚩 [Objective]
- It was made to prepare umbrellas to avoid the rain when traveling abroad or working outside the office.
- It is serviced in Korean because I made it for use. (It plans to support I18N (Internationalization) in a global weather-like manner.)
- I also support a RWD(Responsive Web Design) to be useful on mobile.
